# seegnature
seegnature is a library that supports reading and organizing electroencephalography (EEG) data from a generic data file format of BrainVisionAnalyzer and do machine learning on it. A key feature is creating so-called separability indices with it. They are described by e.g. Blankertz et al. (2011). They help visualizing an assocation of a latent variable / cognitive event and the data recorded from EEG.

Another feature is extracting features of the data based on a visual selection and running various sorts of analyses on them.
